Django basic authentication system

There are times when a developer needs to get his or her app running in no time a might need a basic
authentication app. This project tends to come to your rescue if you fall under such category.

The basic auth system enables you to focus more on the major apps you are developing and simply lets you clone and start using 
this app in your project.

This project comes with a basic auth system and a generic dashboard (Where users are redirected to when they log in.)

Much detail was not given to the frontend, as this would enable another developer to add his or her own frontend ui and 
tweak it as much as they want.
The idea for this project was to keep the code minimal and detailed as possible.
